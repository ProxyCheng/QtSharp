# Changelog

All notable changes to QtSharp will be documented here.

The project is pre-1.0, so APIs and package layouts may change between releases.

## Unreleased

- Added the `QtSharp.Api` binding package: reference it and write Qt applications in C# with no Qt
  SDK or C++ toolchain installed. It ships the managed binding, the native wrapper and the Qt
  runtime, and copies them to the build and publish output.
- Added `tools/build-qt-kit.ps1`, which fetches and discovers the Qt dev files and runtime DLLs
  from Qt's own repository on a machine with nothing Qt installed.
- CI now builds the binding package from the checked-in model on every push.
- Added a tag-driven GitHub Release workflow for `QtSharp.Tools`, including a SHA-256 checksum.
- Added the `QtSharp.Tools` development package with Qt command-line tools.
- Added MSBuild `QtResource` support for compiling `.qrc` files to `.rcc` and copying resources
  during build and publish.
- Added the resources integration sample.
- Added repository governance files, contribution guidance, and CI scaffolding.

## 0.1.0

- Initial development package metadata for `QtSharp.Tools`.
